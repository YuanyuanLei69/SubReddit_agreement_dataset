"I would check with a pharmacist or your Dr.Best wishes","This. And only this.",2
"I'd say you'd get less sick, because your body basically thinks it ""caught"" COVID a week ago, so you're already ahead of the game when it comes to immune system training.","Ok. I finally had my second Pfizer dose this morning and just got notification this evening that my son is a close contact of someone at school that tested positive and is under quarantine for two weeks. I just wondered what would happen if he does get it and then I do so soon.",1

Shoulder pain was deferred pain from the heart , but I was icing it 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off because it felt just like I had torn something inside there .",1
"I got a third Moderna vaccine Saturday, on the advice of my doctor. I live in a low vaccine rate and very low mask usage area. I have an autoimmune disease and take immunosuppressant medications to help manage it. I'm high risk in an area where high risk people are completely on their own to protect themselves. I feel awful this morning. Fatigued, headache, body aches from head to toe. For some reason my collarbones and upper back hurt the worst. Queasy, low appetite. My upper arm that I received the vaccine in feels like someone whacked it with a baseball bat. There's a hard itchy welt at the injection site. But this will pass in a few days, it did after my second vaccine. Except for the injection site reaction, that lingered several days. It's no fun, but no worse than an autoimmune flare. Which is something I experience on a semi-regular basis. My doctor said I really needed to do this and I trust her judgment. I'll just take it easy and get through it.","Ok. I'm getting over the immune system response now. I felt pretty crappy all day Sunday, went to bed very early. Was up a few times through the night and early morning because body aches made it impossible to sleep. Went back to bed around 9 am this morning, woke up around 2 p.m. feeling way better.  Headache gone, body aches gone, feeling hot (but never actually ran a fever) gone, queasiness gone. Just a little bit fatigued and brain foggy this afternoon. So it wasn't really bad with the third vaccine. Hope my body makes good use of it.",1
"You aren’t the only one. I’m in the military and am still on the fence about this whole thing. I either get it or face a discharge. The lack of long term studies as well as reading and personally knowing people getting side effects is what’s stopping me. The science may be there but I’d be pretty pissed getting a serious side effect such as myocarditis from something that was forced. I had covid 3 weeks ago and had no symptoms, as well as no lingering side effects from it. My natural immunity as well as staying in pretty decent health is also what deterring me. Maybe I’m lucky.","Don't give in. There is going to be a major plot twist soon that will cancel this whole forced vaccine thing.",2
"If you're not at serious risk of covid don't get it -- you don't owe anyone to compromise your health for theirs","But the propoganda and collaborative fear says I owe my health for the sake of others right now, ya know? It's something I've never faced before. But I'm 30 and healthy and don't go out in groups or to clubs or anything anymore and I was forced to isolate in one room the entire year for a family I nannied for. Didn't go a SINGLE PLACE FOR A YEAR. I want to feel like that was doing my part! But I had to quit my job because they wanted me to get the vaccine the day it was out and would never drop it. For people who work at home, it's an easy decision, yes or no. As a childcare worker I feel like I have no choice. But your input means so much, I hear you. Thank you.",0
"I got JJ late July (19m, healthy), had horrible fever (103f), chills, and bodyaches that night. Went away as I got more sleep. Day 2-3 I had weird chest pain that made it hard to focus. Ended up getting an EKG and troponine test on my doctors recommendations. Everything came back normal and after like a week I was back to 100% and have had nothing ever since.","Thanks brother! Glad to hear you're in the clear",1
"What were the side effects? I also had some less than ideal side effects but if she thinks this is bad, getting actual Covid is so much worse.","It could be worse or maybe not.",1
"Forgive me if i’m mistaken, but viruses don’t tend to become more deadly as they mutate? Sure, they might be more easily transmitted since the virus adapts and finds different ways to enter your system, but never more deadly, it’s just not how viruses work. Seems a bit misleading to me.","Mutations are random. They could go either way. There is some evolutionary pressure towards lower lethality, because if the virus kills all hosts, it won’t spread. However, we have pretty much maxed out COVID mitigation. Compliance is decreasing every day. Say that a variant emerged with a 35% death rate and a 14 day incubation time (these numbers are not unheard of when it comes to other coronaviruses), what are we going to do? How many people will comply with strict mask mandates and hard lockdowns again? It’s unlikely that such a variant would emerge, but it’s not inconceivable.",1
"I got my second Pfizer shot 4 hours ago. I feel pretty gross so far. Kinda spacey and tired.","The side effects despite being there for a couple days, go away super fast once your immune system's locked in.",1
"This is a documentary vice did about the link between periods and the covid vaccine. People that are saying there is no link are clueless and haven’t did their research, and now there are doctors saying the spike proteins may collect in the ovaries which is causing these problems and complications. I’m not so sure about fertility however but the effect on periods makes me cautious myself as a young female.","Stress can alter menstrual cycles. If someone is stressing over the vaccine, that in and of itself could have an impact.",0
"This is a known side effect of the mRNA injections. Hopefully your heart eventually recovers and are able to avoid the coming booster injections.

Horrifying what society is endorsing.","I feel this way too, but find it strange that so many seem to be pretending this all okay.",2
"I currently have a pretty swollen armpit I dont really feel a node the whole armpit feels swollen. Starting to panic a bit but this kinda made me feel better. How long did the swelling last for you if you don't mind me asking?","Only 3 days with the booster. Had one in my neck with second shot for about 2-3 weeks. They can go anywhere from a couple days to near a month I think",1
"I got the two pfizer shots and about two weeks later got random spots like this. It is an immune system response. I saw a dermatologist. It is nummular eczema. I was prescribed a cream and they are going away. I am so sorry because mine itch so bad and I have never had eczema.","God I really hope I've got the same thing then, seeing others say they've had this for many months is freaking me out. Mine are also itching soooooooooooooooooooooo bad! I can't wait to see someone about it, ty for sharing btw, I'm freaking out a bit less now.",1

"There’s a lot of debate on how effective Pfizer is on delta now … I would wait to get a dose of Pfizer. Wait until the UK announces what their booster plans will be. The UK is doing mix and match studies … wait and see if they recommend a Pfizer after 2 AZs","I can probably wait it out but I don't really like getting infected. Is there absolutely no data about revaccination?",1
"I would ask for some sort of exemption and if not try and find someone who will get you the paperwork to say you got it. I just read that some clinics in some places are selling them to people who don’t want the vaccine and need it to participate in society.  If this happened with the first shot, do not take the second. It could be way dangerous. Your body is telling you no. We are not all made the same and some have dropped dead within hours while others go about their way. Please do not take the second shot. It could do serious damage.","I am in europe we cant pay for this paper. Now i am just anxious with a health problem. What happened if i catch covid now. Before vaccine i wasnt afraid because i was a healthy athlete .",1
"Sudafed is not an antihistamine, it's a decongestant. It's essentially a stimulant.","Yes, did not realize this. Maybe I'll give another antihistamine a try.",1
"I’d opt for Pfizer or Moderna. Maybe you’d fair better with MRNA instead of the traditional vaccine J&amp;J offers. That’s scary. I had Pfizer and really didn’t feel any side effects.","Are you around my age too??",1
"This makes me feel so much better. I had covid December of 2020 and then got the j&amp;j vaccine in April. I had a really rough time after getting the vaccine and then had some other issues pop up right  after. so I have been very anxious about getting a booster! I think I will go ahead and get the Pfizer booster and hope for the best!","Trust me when I say I understand the anxiety completely. Wishing you the best of luck!",1
"Me and my wife, both about 60, got it 10 days ago on a Friday afternoon. About 12 hours later we both woke up with chills; thankfully that only lasted about an hour or so. The next day, we were both severely fatigued, but nothing else...we spent the day just laying around all day. The next day (Sunday), we were pretty much back to normal. We both went to work on Monday (a week ago). Since then, nothing!Knocking on wood now, because I have read accounts of people getting some side effects weeks, or even months later.","Thank you! If it eases your mind my cousin (32) got it about 4 months ago and he's still ok, just be safe!",1
"It's important to note that the injection does not make you immune or stop you from spreading the virus. It also has a 99.8% survival rate, and that's not even considering the probability of you getting the virus in the first place. Ask yourself if it's really worth going through those side effects again. Remember, you cannot undo the vaccine.","I hear ya, but the long term affects of Covid are a big concern for me even if the chances of dying are low. I also have some health issues that put me at greater risk for more severe disease and I’d like to protect myself the best I can. I got a virus before that completely changed my immune response and now I’ve lived with these negative changes in my body for 3 years. I’d rather have some tingling (due to the changes in my immune system from long haulers of another virus) for a few weeks than get severe covid!",0
"Getting the J&amp;J vaccine in 1 hour.  Not Getting myself worked up as I am putting it in God's hands.  I feel the J&amp;J has less side effects than the others.  I am not for or against being vaxxed.  I do slightly feel pushed to get it but realize once it's fully approved  they will make it mandatory.  I will probably start my own post afterwards.","I just got my j&amp;j two hours ago! It wasn’t too bad, a little pain in the arm but so far i feel very relieved . I will update tonight",1
"Well according to a CDC report, 78% of those being hospitalized with covid are overweight or obese. Something to factor into your decision.","Yeah, but it's pretty low for someone in their 30s with only one comorbidity. Still, I go out of my way to prevent catching it, to extreme levels. The only reason I'm looking at getting vaccinated is I'm kind of over it and want to return to some level of normalcy. I've developed really bad problems with anxiety and depression over these past two years. Something has to change, but I'm also worried about vaccine injury, and even if there are no side-effects, I'm concerned with how efficacious the vaccines actually are.

"The protection is not “all or nothing” - it’s not 100%…but it is estimated at 96%+.  That means there will be breakthrough cases, but even then, the vax provides protection by drastically reducing hospitalization and death.","Is it safe to say that this 96% or 95% or whatever high number is now much lower due to the new variants? I still see 95% being thrown out and I cringe every time.",0
"This happened to me, cream of wheat craving, during pregnancy. It's incredibly high in iron. Listen to your body.","It is?? Didn’t know that neat!",1
"What if you got vaccinated and then get a mild case or have no symptoms at all?","All the data suggests that vaccine plus natural immunity offers the greatest possible immunity. If you get the vaccine yet still get a mild breakthrough case, you're probably in pretty good shape going forward. Consider it your booster.",1
"I had covid and am vaccinated. My symptoms would have been bad, but I started taking a fever reducer the instant I felt shitty, so my fever broke at 101. I also broke out in hives, which has NEVER happened to me for any reason ever. 2 weeks after the shot and I have the metallic smell/taste sensation that I had with covid.

"Thank you for asking this. I've been trying to find out too. I've only had one shot of Moderna and a few days later got palpitations and chest pain.  I didn't go to 2nd shot for fear","Yes I'm interested in this as well. I'm now 12 weeks post 1st Pfizer shot.  I've been unwell for a few years still no solid diagnosis.   But I got the first shot. Besides my arm soreness and fatigues, I had really bad heart palpitations for 3 weeks, spikes and drops in blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, bad vertigo, tinnitis, and horrible weakness, again all for weeks.  I support vaccinations but am really concerned with getting the second shot. My doc is reluctant too.  But I'm also very worried about not being fully vaccinated.Very curious if this delay will lessen the potential symptoms after 2nd shot.  Thoughts?  Thank you!",1
"Yes!!! You just proved my original point!!! That the small data pool of 45 didn't have DECREASED sperm counts, but instead showed normal to INCREASED which would not agree with the vaccine having a long term (if any) effect on sperm fertility in those who participated. I simply quoted the other source as a baseline for anyone who didn't know what is normally encountered","I disagree that a 90 day time frame with not only seasonal variations but non-strict abstinence time frames demonstrates anything long term in a sample size of 45 men.",0
"3.5 BILLION people have received at least one dose of a vaccine. Hospitals and doctor's offices are not buckling under the pressure of people suffering side effects, but they ARE buckling under the pressure of unvaccinated patients. I must raise a big issue with one line of this post in particular: ""the political decisions regarding the pandemic are making it very complicated for the unvaccinated to lead a normal, healthy life.""It is your lack of vaccination that's making it hard for you to live a healthy life, not a policy of vaccination. It's a flatly absurd statement.","In fairness, people who have an anxiety over the vaccine are suspicious of the long-term effects of the virus, not the short term, so your first paragraph is really not responding to those concerns. Like many others, you're creating a bit of a straw man here. I'm not saying you're wrong, but your argument doesn't really touch on the anxieties or the issues levied at the vaccine by scientists and doctors.",0
"I wish the conversations were more open and welcoming. I personally have not gotten the vaccine and I’m not exactly planning to. I don’t have extremely strong opinions against it or for it. But I do wish we could all talk about it in this way rather than being condescending and such, and being labelled dumb, ignorant, “anti-vaxxer”,etc. Everyone should be able to do their own research and talk to each other openly and make their decision without being bribed or pressured into it. Thank you for starting this thread!","Same. I personally just dont feel comfortable getting it because there is not enough peer reviewed data for the long term effects of this vaccine for me to feel like I made a informed decision. I wish that was respected. I already had COVID and I barely had symptoms. So I feel comfortable risking not getting vaccinated. If the vaccine doesnt prevent getting the virus nor the spread, if it just decreases the severity of the symptoms of COVID then how is it exactly stopping it? Why is it that vaccinated people feel like they are all of a sudden invincible? Especially with these new variants. It sucks that if I ask questions all of a sudden people make it seem like I'm stupid. I work in Neurology and I've seen alot of people having post covid vaccine related issues. Mostly neuropathy, but it has also triggered autoimmune diseases in others. This is all anecdotal but I see enough of it to question getting it.",2

"Objectlivly your vaccinations are not protective of you or those around you when you get Covid, which, likely you will.   Use prophylatic neutraceuticals such as niger sativa (black cumin), quercetin, zinc, magnesium, melatonin, Vitamins D3 and K2, B vitamin complex, vitamin C in time release every day.   Look up the reccommended nasal washes (spray or drip), and gargle with a protective mouthwash.

Is it worse when you lay down?","It was when worse lying in bed last night, particularly on my left side. It's not as bad this morning though. Are there symptoms I should look out for/monitor? Actually I just lied down for a couple minutes and the beating in my ear started to come back",1
"Did you have regular blood work done before this vaccine at some point? Were you anemic or low on b12? Not that that you should be required to do that before a vaccine, but a lot of people keep saying they're 'healthy' that have had sever reactions, but i wonder whether these people (perhaps you as well) had an underlining condition exaggerating this reaction.","Yes, I've had bloodwork done several times in the last 2 years and everything was normal.",1

Woke up at 5am and felt horrible. Low grade fever and lots of muscle aches and headache. Stayed in bed all day. By Sunday morning, I was fine…like it never even happened.  My 14 year old nephew got Pfizer and had no reaction to either shot. Everyone in my house had the same reaction to Moderna. My parents had no problems with Moderna. My brother got J&amp;J and felt bad the next day. Much like Covid-19, people have varying responses to the vaccine. You are experiencing what my family experienced. Hope it goes away soon. But know your symptoms are normal. We were all better in about a day or so.","This is very reassuring to read as i am experiencing all of that in a (hopefully) similar timeline. Thank you.",1
"As others have said LVH takes years to develop and is a consequence of things like hypertension, heart valve issues, etc.. So with 100% certainty you didn’t develop LVH from the vaccine.   Also a solitary ekg at an urgent care is absolutely not confirmatory for LVH.  The cardiologist will be the one to determine that.  Now is the immune response to the vaccine causing you symptoms? Quite possible, but these symptoms should be short lived.","Thanks. Didn’t mean to be alarmist. My theory is the LVH was present before the vaccine, but the immune response made the symptoms pronounced and noticeable when they were not previously. Are there any similar case studies with immune responses triggering underlying heart issues associated with the vaccine?",1
"I think we tend to notice reactions similar to ours. I had an adverse reaction after the first and I sought out posts from people with a similar experience.  IRL, I know a lot of people that had a stronger response for the second dose and boostered individuals who had no reaction to the third. The booster should have the same composition as the first two doses if you stuck with the same manufacturer. It’s the same shot. Only exception is the moderna booster is a half dose of the regular shot.","What was your reaction to the first?",1

Let me say that again, these vaccines do no affect fertility in any way at all. There's no way for the vaccine to do that. It sounds like you need to evaluate your relationship though. I'd beat your boyfriend to the punch and get rid of him. If he's willing to break up with you over the vaccine he's not worth another day of your life. He doesn't value you and your thoughts.

"That’s fascinating to me. There’s a tendency to assume that all vaccinated people are pro-vaccine and all unvaccinated people are anti-vaccine. But your experience suggests that there’s also vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated people.","The pro-vaxx and anti-vaxx controversy is stupid imho.  A lot of people have had very mild course of the disease and say, what is the fuss? Should I take a vaccine against every cold I may get?

Just b/c it came early this month doesn’t mean it will be like that every month.","I actually don’t start college till the 20th, I’m still currently in my hometown and everything I’m a junior and have definitely been way more stressed out before and still got my period on time.

"I always think about people who have terrible reactions to the vaccines, are they more likely to suffer from Covid worse?

Or maybe it’s the opposite I dunno.Always wondered about that, sounds like you had a shit vaccine experience.  I can understand your hesitancy.","My husband and I both had horrible, long lasting side effects from the vaccine. There’s no way in hell either of us are getting more shots.

I can't get the vaccine because of allergy issues and EVERYONE I know has been vaccinated and, despite my health issues, I am receiving a lot of pressure to get the vaccine!  People who I thought would be supportive have been very judgemental, totally dismissing the possiblity that I might have an allergic reaction to the vaccine, and it has been terrible.  We all must be able to listen to our intuition and our health professionals who we trust to decide whether to get the vaccine or not.  I 100% respect people for getting the vaccine and I 100% respect people who choose not to get the vaccine.  It isn't a moral issue, particulary because I am taking all the precautions I have for the past year so I am not out there infecting other people.  It is a real pitty that this has become so politized.  I think we just have to wait it out and eventually there will be something else everyone is polarized over.

"This is just my guess, but it could be your body’s immuno response. When fighting off infection, your heart rate can tend to elevate, which your body is fighting as a response to the vaccine (mimicking infection) I just got my 2nd dose yesterday and I am pretty sure I noticed the same thing. As for the shortness of breath, it could be anxiety related because you are scared of the possibility of having symptoms. I had covid July 2020 and I haven’t felt the same since with breathing, but I genuinely think it is because of how anxious I have become about shortness of breath ever since covid started. When I’m not thinking about it, no trouble breathing. When I’m thinking about it, lots of trouble breathing. I also have an anxiety disorder related to medicine and the fear of infection/medicine so it makes it a lot worse for me. You’re okay! Everything is okay. (Also F early 20’s)","Thank you! I guess it’s a good thing then that it’s reacting to the vaccine! I have zero anxiety luckily, I was expecting to get all fluey and so have been quite pleased this is my only symptom haha. I was curious to see if other people had it, because it’s not reported as a side effect often (well apart from the NHS saying you should seek urgent care which is very dramatic, and I assume for much higher heart rates).

"The surprising findings came as a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended against offering booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine to all Americans ages 16 and older. In a striking rebuke, 16 of 18 experts told the agency it had not mustered enough data to make a third shot the norm.In lengthy briefings to the panel, representatives from Pfizer pointed to clinical trial results involving 306 mostly healthy participants to argue that a booster ""restores"" the 95% vaccine effectiveness rate seen earlier in the pandemic.Company officials also touted evidence from Israel, which rolled out boosters after seeing a rise in hospitalizations among people who were fully vaccinated. Those hospitalizations dropped dramatically after third doses were given, Israeli scientists have said.But panel members made clear that despite Pfizer's aggressive stance, it had not gathered enough evidence that a third shot was safe for young people and for those at lesser risk of becoming severely ill with COVID-19.","The odd thing with all 3 vaccines, J&amp;J, Moderna and Pfizer is based on the news they all seem to have caused a possible increase in heart problems in younger adults from 16 to 30 years old at a higher rate than older people.

But it was not well publicized on June 25 when our FDA told Pfizer and Moderna to add the same possible heart issues to their fact sheets and increased the age range to 39.The heart issues do seem to effect more younger adults at a higher percentage based on age range, but in various studies from 30 to 45% of the people who experienced heart problems after taking the vaccines were over 40 years old.",2

I wish that was respected. I already had COVID and I barely had symptoms. So I feel comfortable risking not getting vaccinated. If the vaccine doesnt prevent getting the virus nor the spread, if it just decreases the severity of the symptoms of COVID then how is it exactly stopping it?

It sucks that if I ask questions all of a sudden people make it seem like I'm stupid. I work in Neurology and I've seen alot of people having post covid vaccine related issues.

That the MOST common symtoms are NOT super high fever and constant vommiting. I got both Moderna shots and guess what - only had a sore arm and a heachache.  Luck? Or maybe cuz I hydrated well for two weeks, slept well, ate healthy and meditated? I believe that ppl have bad reactions and that’s unfortunate.  But Im THANKFUL that it didnt change my mind. There are so many factors: genetics, LIFESTYLE (some ppl don’t sleep well/eat well or take care of themselves), and eveyone’s threshold is diff (your idea of a sore arm and fatigue is diff from mine).

Also the lower antibody higher B/T cell response favors those with good immune systems to begin with but is probably not best for immunocompromised seniors. Once you start expanding time ranges and age groups it’s efficacy is pretty much identical to its phase 3 trial numbers.Given the side effects of all these vaccines it should be given primarily to younger males where it would have most efficacy and not have the myocarditis risk. Whereas younger females should probably get Moderna.",0

"I've seen people here on reddit post how they got infected after having had covid previously and gotten both vaccines.

While there isn't any data to prove this yet, I actually think that taking the vaccine after having covid will increase your chances of being infected again. The reason I think this is because immunity from prior infection is proving to be much better than immunity from the vaccines. And when you take the vaccines, you override your prior immunity with the immunity provided by vaccination. Just a theory, but I think that will end up being true.","Not how that works at all. Your body doesn't ""override"" previously acquired immunity. It does eventually forget about it, if you don't keep encountering the same virus in the environment though, and the vaccine is a new encounter, reminding your body to re-up it's commitment to looking for that virus. We don't have good long term evidence yet as to what immunity remains after a year or more, because the virus hasn't been around long enough to do those studies, but every bit of previous experience we have with viruses and vaccines is that the effect is additive. Vaccines improve and extend your natural immunity.",0

"You don't. Asking this question shouldn't be so normalized.

"The vaccine does NOT protect you from contracting Covid. It’s designed to help you not get super sick if you get Covid.

But some said that they were escorted down to the ER at the hospital at which they were employed, for observation or treatment. Others were driven home by colleagues. Why would they have anxiety at the idea of the shot? They were eager to take it, were relieved at the thought of finally protecting themselves.

"A few questions from someone who is..... scientifically challenged1. Using at least my common sense, your antibodies decreased significantly from months 1-4, finishing out at 47au/ml. What kind of protection does 47au/ml give you? For example, best estimates show the vaccine to be what, 91-95% effective after the second dose? and around 80-95% from one dose of either MRNA vaccines. What % of effectiveness would you assume you are at now after 4 months? 2. I am currently thinking of skipping the second dose for right now due to side effects, most prevalent being Myocarditis; do you think that waiting a month and letting my antibodies from the first injection diminish a little, then getting the second vaccine dose reduce my risk of side effects?3. More so a statement, but I wonder how much waiting a few months before doing your second dose will effect the longevity of antibodies compared to people following the normal CDC schedule","Antibody protection against COVID is not the way most people get over COVID.  People who recover from COVID often have less antibody production than those that get very sick.  Cell mediated immunity is king for infections like COVID.

Science is not something to be “followed” it is something to be questioned.

"I have two friends who had shingles recently- one, after vaccination, the other, after getting Covid-19. Because shingles is dormant varicella zoster, any actual infection or immune response (getting all ramped up to FIGHT THE INVADERS! even if there are none) can trigger a shingles outbreak.Unfortunately those of us who had chickenpox when we were younger might face this later on down the line. At present though it's my understanding that if you get shingles at any point prior to the typical recommended date for Shingrix, you can get Shingrix with a prescription. Shingrix also has a pretty strong systemic response, similar to vaccines against covid.This is kinda in line with me getting a cold sore after I got vaccinated- but it also happens when I get sick or stressed. Stinking dormant viruses!Without a doubt, shingles is preferable to Covid-19, especially at her age. But she could have easily gotten it soon regardless. Nasty stuff.  ETA: there also might be a coincidence more generally- seems that shingles is on the rise because so many people are now vaccinated against chickenpox, so we're not exposed to is as often and small exposures tend to tamp it down over time.

"Hi, fellow emetephobe here! Nausea and vomiting are very rare side effects, and are usually seen in people who get nauseous and vomit any time they feel slightly off (even with just a fever or a headache), and who are generally stomach-y people. Remember that as emetephobes, our brain is really freaking powerful at not letting us throw up. A lot of people vomit way more easily than we do. I didn’t get Pfizer myself, but from a logistics standpoint, it’s a smaller dosage than the Moderna vaccine (30 micrograms versus 100 micrograms), which means it has less of a chance of those kind of side effects. And I believe (need to find the source on this) if you look at the studies released after the initial vaccine trials, the incidence of nausea and vomiting were the same for the experimental group and the placebo group. So it’s possible those people got sick because they’re sensitive to needles, or because they’re just stomach-y people. A word of advice - eat well before you get the shot, hydrate very well with electrolytes 24-48 hours before you get the shot, and buy yourself some soup, saltine crackers, and maybe make some plain white rice to have read to eat after your shot. Keep hydrated very well with electrolytes 3-4 days after your shot (Pedialyte, Gatorade works well). Avoid foods that might cause inflammation (for example, if you’re lactose intolerant, don’t eat dairy for a few days before or after the shot). The side effects are caused by the inflammation triggered by your immune response to the vaccine. So anything you can do to keep your inflammation low will help. And staying hydrated and fed will help you so much!You’ve got this. And you will be fine, I promise. I got J&amp;J and had 0 nausea and vomiting. There are people on the emetephobe sub who have gotten fully vaccinated with Pfizer and have been fine. You can do it!!!PS - the risk of vomiting because of covid, especially the Delta variant, is so much greater than the risk that comes with the shot. So you’re way better off getting the shot.

So while I've moved on with *my* life and am living pretty normally again, I'm also scared we're going to backslide because of vaccine hesitancy. I got Pfizer and my side effects were only on dose 2 and lasted about 48 hours. Mostly I just had a headache and was very tired.

Unfortunately I was nudged in the direction of getting vaccinated by my college. Religious or health reasons could have worked as an exemption but I was leaning towards getting vaccinated anyways.

I did do a lot of research and thinking about whether or not to get vaccinated. I am very conscious about what I put in my body (don't drink, smoke, do drugs, only take medication when absolutely necessary). My main conclusions were that I would rather have something that was designed to help (?) my body than something that is designed (in a lab through gain-of-function research?) to cause my body harm. Yes, we don't know the long-term side effects of the vaccine. But we also don't know the long-term side effects of COVD-19. It's sad but it's kind of a lose lose situation.

I was advised if my Covid infection was not recent I would be better off with two, so that’s what I did, since I had covid early on, in March 2020. Perhaps I still had antibodies or some immunity, because my reaction to the first dose was intense. But I had seen my cousin get covid again 9 months after her first infection, so I wanted to be on the safe side; as well as not have to deal with travel issues from only one dose. The second one went great for me, hardly any side effects. But regarding side effects- you’re not guaranteed to have a hard time.

I live in a very cold climate so can't spend that much time outdoors.I understand that this is exactly the point of Covid restrictions - to force a person 'willingly' take the vaccine. It's not about safety (for example, vaccinated people were relieved of their responsibility to take Covid related precautions despite the fact that they can transmit the virus). There are only about 20% unvaccinated people/people without antibodies in my country but somehow this minority poses an extreme threat to the society, and the whole healthcare system might collapse.Aside from this rant...

"My thought would be to look into the excipient list and locate the ingredients. Moderna and Pfizer use polyethylene glycol which some have allergic reactions to. Think plastic allergies or an allergy to Miralax. The johnson and Johnson has polysorbate 80 which is a byproduct of polyethylene glycol and can cause the same allergic reaction. Not saying you're dealing with an allergic reaction.

"I think a lot of people are misunderstanding something in this thread. Yes, it seems that the rate of hospitalizations are generally around the same among COVID cases in vaccinated groups and unvaccinated groups, so it seems the older notion that vaccines will cause you to have a milder illness if you get COVID-19 isn't that true if this data is correct (I think).However, here's the thing - the rate of hospitalizations (severe illness) is the same among **cases of COVID-19**, not among the general population. Vaccination reduces your chance of getting COVID-19 by 95%, so therefore, it ALSO reduces your chance of severe illness by 95%.Let's say there was a population of 100,000 unvaccinated people and they were all thoroughly exposed to COVID-19 and got it, so, 100,000 cases of COVID-19. Let's assume 1% of them died. That'd mean that 1000 people died, right?Now let's say there's a population of 100,000 vaccinated people, and they were all exposed to COVID-19 in the same way. Let's assume the vaccine is 95% effective, so that means 5% of people get COVID-19. 5000 people get COVID-19, which are classified as breakthrough cases. The death rate is still 1%, but it's 1% of the cases - so 1% of 5000, which would be 50 deaths. Catch my drift? If you compare the two death numbers, it actually means that the odds of vaccinated people dying of COVID-19 is 95% lower than unvaccinated people dying from COVID-19. 1000 deaths versus 50 deaths.If there's something I'm misunderstanding, please let me know. Just looking to help!","Thank you! This does ease my nerves a bit. Do they know what went wrong in the remaining 5% for the vaccine not to work? I’m guessing it didn’t create an immune response? Is it typically the person is older (immune system not as good) or immunosuppressive? Or just bad luck?",1
"Thanks for sharing your perspective. No I was not on any medication by the time I got the vaccine, nor did I ever have any problems with my hair. After my experience I can only warn you about the Pfizer vaccine. I was a normal person until I got that vaccine and there was no indication that I would suffer such outcome. If what happened to me over the past couple of weeks were to happen to a teenager that might cause severe mental health problems. So in the interest of your daughter think twice before you vaccinate her with Pfizer. The added problem is that health care professionals take the position that there is no evidence that my condition was caused by the vaccine. They claim this is very common and I likely would have developed it even without the vaccine. However timing is very suspicious. I feel pretty much left alone with the issue.","I’m right there with you! Our timelines with Pfizer are identical. I was battling with women in a TE group on Facebook bc they kept saying no way could it be the vaccine! Until MANY other people started commenting they also believe the vaccine caused their hair loss! Even just a couple of weeks after the first shot! Like me. You are not alone. Some people just don’t want this to be out in the public in fear others won’t want to get vaccinated but people have a right to know the side effects and I’m pro vaccine myself!",2
"its a relative risk. original the infection rates for kids where very low. so if you have to vax 1000 kids but would expect only 10 kids would get it anyway, the risk for the 990 kids doesnt outweigh the benefits. now with omikron you see the highest infection rates with kids and due to increased R and spreading its now more like WHEN you get - not IF you get it. Therefore the effect of protection far outweigh the risk of the vaccine itself.","It’s not about cases but hospitalization and death. They said they’d need to vaccinate 1 million children to save one life. If those 1 million vaccines kill a single child it would be ill advised. The vaccines also cause myocarditis and pericarditis more than 1 in a million in teens. We don’t have child data because the study was way too few participants to know the safety, according to the FDA in response to the Pfizer trials.",0
"So half of the deaths are vaccinated people?","No, vaccinated people are not half the deaths.They're saying that the 17% of people who are unvaccinated makeup 50% of the deaths.So at a *minimum*, being vaccinated makes you 2.9 times less likely to die of covid.Of course, a bunch of those vaccinated folks who are infected are very old and/or on immunosuppressive medications.

Your chances of being hit by a car or choking to death or dying from food borne illness are much higher than dying from the vaccine. This is not the place to be asking because this sub is overrun by antivax trolls.

Now throw in the fact that you’re directly allergic to an ingredient that’s actually in the vaccine, and that is a no brainer!

I can’t speak for the other vaccines, but would imagine the moderna one may also contain PEG, but not sure.

Based on my intimate knowledge of the situation, the dozens of labs that were drawn on baby, as well as mom, were all negative.  There is only one more test to run when the baby turns 1.  Vaers reporting shows many other situations much like ours, also.

"Lots of different factors come into play and need to be considered when basing your medical decisions on what is known about the myocarditis risk. The answer also depends on the datasets used.It's important to remember that in those who do get myocarditis, 95% resolved with rest and are mild. In the Israel study for example, men aged 12-29 were 4 in 100,000. So non-mild myocarditis would have been 1 in 500,000. When considering this data in relation to your medical decisions you should consult a doctor.Things to be weighed are this risk vs your risk of getting covid, which is almost guaranteed at this point, and your risk of long term complications or myocarditis from getting covid etc.It's a difficult statistical game.","My risk of developing serious complications from the coronavirus as a young, thin, healthy male is very low. My risk of being infected with the coronavirus is also very low in general. Especially due to my lifestyle, like working from home (and loving it), having a small network of friends, introverted hobbies and actively wearing masks, my risk of being infected is very low, perhaps near zero. My risk of developing serious adverse reactions to the vaccines are also very low. However, when I take the vaccine, I intentionally expose myself to that risk, and I am guaranteed that risk. On top of that, the vaccines aren’t even that good. They are not some magical guarantee of immunity, and aren’t as effective as one would expect from a vaccine. On top of that, 2/3 of the vaccines that have been available to me, are now no lingered offered to me because the risk profile is too high. It’s not exactly tempting.",0

While there isn't any data to prove this yet, I actually think that taking the vaccine after having covid will increase your chances of being infected again.

And when you take the vaccines, you override your prior immunity with the immunity provided by vaccination.

I wish that was respected. I already had COVID and I barely had symptoms. So I feel comfortable risking not getting vaccinated.

"I’m in the same boat and have actually gotten to week 15 and still don’t feel safe getting it. Have spoken to drs and everyone says same to just get it I’ll be fine. Still don’t feel like I can just push myself to get it but feel like I have no options. I’m pro vax, but terrified of clots.","I'm so sorry you are struggling too.  On the bright side, you are not completely unprotected at the moment.  If you need to talk or just to feel that you are not alone in this, let me know.",1
"I can somewhat understand your concern. I think it’s everyone’s own decision to do as they please (as long as it’s legal obviously). Them not wanting the vaccine is fine and you not wanting them near your potential child is also fine. I think the key here is communication, express your feelings and reasons in a civil way. Perhaps there could even be a middle ground where they agree to be tested before visiting, or maybe by the time you have kid(s) your in-laws have already been vaccinated. Idk about talking to them about this before even being pregnant to be honest but that’s entirely up to you.","It's a hard call. I'm worried if I bring it up when I'm pregnant, it will put a damper on it. Like maybe if I say something in advance it will give them longer time to process? But idk lol maybe I'll be infertile and it will have been pointless. Not sure what the right move is. Wait to tell them and potentially deal with that stress during the pregnancy or tell them in advance and maybe not get pregnant for 2-3 years or be infertile.",1
"Hi hun, I completely understand how you feel. I felt the exact same way. However I did end up getting the vaccine. I developed nerve damage a week after the first dose. I was told not to take the second dose. Now my job mandated the vaccine. I have no idea what to do. Risk my health and take the second vaccine or switch careers. What career? Everyone is mandating it!

I don’t know what you choose to do but choose wisely.","Fake ass accounts created to spread false information",0
"I had the same thing happen to me about two weeks after Pfizer vaccine.  It’s been a little over two weeks since it started and I am still having hives.  It comes and goes throughout the day.  Nothing new to my diet or routine.  I’ve never been allergic to anything.  Interesting that shingles was mentioned on thread because I had shingles two years ago","Yeah same here, I’ve never had any allergic reactions or didn’t change my diet or routine. Luckily after about a week and a few days they seem to have stopped appearing",1
"Possibly a coincidental experience , the mRNA vaccine has no link to HSV . It simply doesn’t work that way . All the vaccine does is essentially teaches your body to make a specific immune body to fight off the COVID virus . Both viruses are of a completely different genetic makeup , therefore there should be no link . However , there’s one more theory . The vaccine does cause an immune response and this can flare up your HSV . When your immune system is low , HSV almost always flares up. Immune system keeps it in check. In this case , your immune system was focused on the Covid spike protein antibodies thus giving the chance for HSV to take over . I would prescribe Valtrex 500mg to clear it up","Thanks for the reply! I haven't taken any antivirals yet as my obs were minimal and only caused some discomfort from clothing but if the pattern continues then I will definitely load up on my prescription as my physican did refill my antivirals kind of just curious if they continue monthly or I go back to how I was no obs for years. Guess only time will tell.",1
"Nope he will be sterilized and he will have problems with his blood and it can kill him on top of that","Where did you get that? By what mechanism? Wouldn't the disease then also do that. I'm worried about myocarditis which is based on facts.

"Real people? I don't think you need to beg for this. There are a lot of real people with no education who will fill your head with bullshit because they don't understand. And you'll believe it because neither do you.

If you don't want it, don't get it just know that you will be directly responsible for new variants. Ffs grow up.","And there are lots of people with lots of education who actually care about the safety and well being of people who can offer legit reasons either way.",0
"I am 28y never got covid either and feeling the same as you. I wanted to get the vaccine back in February when I was not eligible. Now that I am, and also kind of pushed by the government and public opinion in order to do so, I am not convinced anymore. I thought the vaccines would have stopped the infection, it seems is not. Also, it weirdly seems that vaccines are causing issues in a lot of young guys like me while they caused less issues to older people. I am kind of a bitch on getting sick in general, and I am very scared of getting covid. I am also very scared on getting a vaccine and potentially get sick as well because of that. I am waiting time to pass and I would like to see more studies around the impact of vaccines in young people. I also would like to understand whether I will need to get vaccinated once a year. The risk of covid on young people should be limited, the fact vaccinated people also spread the virus makes me feel less guilty also. I really would love to get a vaccine which will ultimately kill the virus but this is clearly not the case. And risk reward ratio for my age seems too unbalanced atm. You are not alone!","Well said. This is how I feel.",2
"So Oxford university conducted a research on their own product, and came to a conclusion that it is safe? No conflict of interest lol","lol. Are you accusing the scientists of lying? Even though over a billion doses have been administered worldwide with no more adverse effect than is seen with most vaccines?! What a stupid plan that would be. Never mind that the study is also about their chief competitor Pfizer and independently assessed for safety and efficacy by several medicine agencies worldwide, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and the World Health Organization (WHO), and that by July over one billion doses of the vaccine had been released to more than 170 countries worldwide?Okay, buddy.",0
"For those who have received the Moderna booster…can you confirm that the dose size is in fact a half of the traditional dose (that they use on the 1st + 2nd shots)?","I specifically asked the pharmacist who administered my booster and they confirmed it was 1/2 the original Moderna dose.",2
"In the US, there were a fair number of athletes who got myocarditis from Covid in their 20s. So, I think it is unlikely the vaccine has a higher risk than remaining unvaccinated.","Yes it's an apples to oranges comparison OP is making. Should look at instances of myocarditis with the vaccine (with no previous covid) vs. with covid.",2
"The good thing is that you've just had the vaccine and hopefully those symptoms will dissipate soon. I had the exact same symptoms of the upper left throbbing/fluttering sensation under the ribcage and that lasted for about 2 months. Other symptoms have been hellish and longer lasting but this sub is not exactly the best place for discussing negative Vax effects. Wishing you the best.","Any sense as to what is causing the rib cage feeling? That was basically my fist symptom that came on a few hours post vax, but I didn’t think much of it initially.",1
"So the vaccine doesn’t even work? I’m not an antivaxxer (I’ve already had one shot), but I don’t understand what the point of a vaccine is if it doesn’t work.","It works, just not 100% of the time.   Time will tell.",0
"the number of teenagers having heart complications, seizures, and other ""side effects"" from these are very high.. they are just trying to protect you. im not anti vax but no way would I encourage my child or teen to get these. The officials say there's no long term complications but real peoples stories and deaths say otherwise","It’s impossible to know the long term complications as so little time has passed. But it’s unlikely to be anything significant as if there were any indications that there would be, then it would never have been approved",0
"Can your doctor give you an amended letter confirming your condition and his recommendation on not to get the vaccine? Will they accept it?

If you can get a letter you have a much stronger case on your behalf. That’s how I managed to get my exemption. It was not easy though. You first have to find a doctor who will sign it, but you seem to already have good report and a case.","Can I ask what problems the vaccine has caused u to get medical exception? Hope you’re okay! The first dose of the vaccine has caused me a lot of issues which haven’t been discovered by the doctors what it could potentially be",1
"I just asked this in another sub. What will the unvaccinated do? Not work? I didn’t get good answers.","If the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated were the only ones that could work the country wouldn't survive.  Look at the unemployment now, if close to 50% of the country was added to that do you think businesses could stay open? The largest percent of vaccinated people are close to or over retirement age.",2
"Sounds like pleurisy. I've got an immune system disorder and lockdown last year had me stuck in a mouldy house all winter so I ended up in hospital 5 times with pneumonia and pleurisy, twice already so far this winter. Basically it's lung inflammation, usually from a respiratory infection, sometimes autoimmune diseases. Wouldn't surprise me since the vaccine gives you a dose of it if you already have poor health.","See I thought that could have been it, but breathing isn't really an issue for me. :/",0
"Does anyone how what is typical cost of heart screening for myocarditis in US?","This is key. Why aren't followup for vaccine related issues covered? ..oh yeah they have a liability waiver. Everyone could drop dead in 18 months and no pharma can gets sued.",2
"Damn just realized you said they asked about varicose veins and I’m pretty sure I have them (testes) maybe j&amp;j isn’t what I should get.","From my research, it's a much bigger problem in women than in men. Anyway, if you have a vaccine centre with say, Pfizer and J&amp;J you can talk to them there and they'll advise you based on your health conditions. In general, predisposition to blood clots depends on the behaviour too, travelling a lot (especially by plane) or living a sedentary lifestyle, sitting/laying down a lot can also increase the risks.",1
"You don't need the vaccine, except if you have any health issues that make COVID dangerous for you (e.g. obesity, diabetes, etc.)","We need the vaccine so the virus stops mutating into a virus that eats unvaccinated morons brains(no-it has already done that).",0
"Curious about why youre stoked?","Um…my body has developed immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without me having to get the illness because I got the vaccine. Stoked! I’m going to assume good intent in your question and hope you are just being curious and not baiting me…",0
"You should have waited for a one shot vaccine to be available. I waited for J&amp;J because I want my vaccine to be one and done.","I was scheduled for J&amp;J literally the day it was pulled by the govt, so I went for Pfizer instead. Of course, ended up not being able to get my ass motivated enough to do the second one. Should've just waited for it to reenter the market, but I didn't know if/when that was gonna happen. Needle phobia &amp; syncope reactions are a bitch.",1

"Been waiting for news about J&amp;J and a booster. This looks promising. I got my jab at the end of March, so I'll be looking at getting a second shot when it's approved!","I’m wondering if it will still be considered a “one shot”? I assume so since they’re referring to it as a booster. Hope it becomes available soon, the six month mark for the first recipients is September if I am calculating correctly.",1
"My first AZ reaction was horrific, I would say I had a severe reaction but my second dose was super mild like yours. I had a couple side effects but it was nothing compared to my first!","That's interesting. What were the mild side effects, if you could share please?",1

"Covid was so painful. I didn’t have enough energy to even make coffee. It was hard to breathe. Everything hurt. I never did get my sense of smell back, and it’s been a year. For the vaccine the side effects were on par with a flu shot. So worth not getting Covid again. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated.

"Just a heads up the 2nd shot can be a bit of a doozy for some.  Make sure you keep hydrated and keep the ibprofen or whatever rolling.  It's *definitely* better than catching the virus.  I've had both (also Moderna) so I can say that with 100% confidence lol  Got my last jab back in Feb.  I'm on the short list for the booster (work in healthcare)","I don't know which part of healthcare you work in, but I imagine every single job no matter how ""small"" is incredibly stressful right now.

"I’m 4 months out from my second Pfizer shot. I have had multiple negative and long lasting side-effects (eerily similar to “long COVID”). I’ve wanted to cry several times in regret. I feel like I’ve given myself something like an autoimmune disorder. Most annoying is that I start to feel better and think I’m over them only for them to re-emerge a few days later.

"Maybe the vaccine makes it easier for people to get sick? Like having compromised immune systems or something. Maybe if they hadn’t had an injection, no one would have gotten sick at all, but now they all have weakened immune systems, so everyone gets sick easier?","I remember when Plato pondered the same very question.",0
"When did you get your 3rd shot? And when did you get your antibody test? Also curious how you got it? I thought that protection from 3rd shot comes after 2 weeks, similar to what they said about the 2nd shot.

"Getting the vaccine is a PERSONAL decision. Dont let anyone force you into getting something that YOU dont want in your body. If they are mad oh well. Its not their body so whats their issue? No one should be judged for getting or not getting it. Do your own research and decide for yourself. If its not what you want then dont get it because remember even vaccinated people can get the virus. It just lowers the severity of it. I didnt want it at first. I had to weigh the pros and cons. Take care and do whats best for YOU!!!","Thanks for the response! This is exactly the stuff I love to hear. Weighing the pros and cons is what I'm doing, and per another comment on my post, I may consult my doctor and receive their thoughts.",2
"Yes, the vaccine is safe for you! Covid-19 is not safe for you.

I hope you feel better soon.","Unfortunately the only reaction they will accept exemption for is immediate anaphylactic shock or myocarditis and good luck getting any doctor to actually sign one - I asked 3 of the doctors treating me (so they know how serious my reaction was) and they said they could risk their job if they sign it.

"I got boosted. Kind of wish I didn’t. They need a vaccine that doesn’t cause swollen lymph nodes and rashes. I could handle fatigue, headache, and a low fever as side effects.

"The covid vaccination does not cross the placenta and will not ""affect"" the baby. It does not increase any risks of bad outcomes for your pregnancy.

"It makes sense. A lot of the immunity develops in the nasal region when you get actual corona. That causes a lot of anti bodies to be present in the mucus membranes in your nose and throat, ready to pounce at the gates. When you get a vaccine you get none of that.

"Being an Asian, I opted for J&amp;J as their clinical trial data had a lot more persons of color, native Americans, and Alaskans than Moderna or Pfizer. Modera had more specifically Asians than J&amp;J,  native Alaskans share a lot of genetic history with Japanese and Koreans which I am a descendant of so that's why I opted for that. The injection itself was quite unpleasant and it burned quite a bit compared to all the other vaccines I get regularly such as the seasonal flu vaccine.  The actual location of the injection might have been bad with the wrong length of the needle used. Typically they use 25guage, 1-inch needle, 1 mL syringe filled to 500 uL dose. What I saw was a 2-inch needle, but I didn't really question it, felt like it hit the bone and injected on the surface of the bone instead of in the middle of the deltoid muscle. My arm felt dead immediately and my whole arm felt like it was burning for at least several hours, an indication that the needle or the injection fluid barely hit on the auxiliary radial nerve in my arm.  Then had a high fever for 2 days following the vaccine, starting about 12 hours after the injection. Then heavy generalized fatigue and nausea for about 2 weeks, and getting better on my 3rd week.  General mood disruptions more than I'm used to, and a return of my seasonal allergies that I haven't had for over 5 years.  My sore arm has just gotten better the last few days after a more aggressive arm workout and massage treatment.Overall, I think my side effects are still on the milder side compared to what some people experience.... but it could be due to a bad injection techniqe.","Thanks for sharing!

While there isn't any data to prove this yet, I actually think that taking the vaccine after having covid will increase your chances of being infected again. The reason I think this is because immunity from prior infection is proving to be much better than immunity from the vaccines. And when you take the vaccines, you override your prior immunity with the immunity provided by vaccination. Just a theory, but I think that will end up being true.","Great points. Agree.",2

There is evidence that suggests natural immunity is actually better than vaccination due to an immune response to more parts of the virus than just the spike. The thing with testing for antibodies is that it's a whole process and it's much easier financially and logistically to just jab everybody, even if it is not necessary to do so. That doesn't mean that they should bar the people who don't want to do it from testing out.

In my country if you had covid in last 3 months you don't need a jab but with more than 3 months it is advised to get the vaccine (also mandatory for traveling if you don't want your 1000th test).Honestly everyone who can get a vaccine should get it. The benefits of a vaccine surpasses the negatives by far. As for me personally I have a Pfizer. So has my gf and my family ranging from a 16 year old cousin to 83 years old grandma. No severe side effects. My dad had covid 8days after getting the first dose when the vaccine isn't fully developed. Even though he was sick for a month it was fairly weak covid considering he's 66years old and that was almost certainly thanks to the vaccine as he has some other health problems that are considered bad if you catch covid. Also he has no signs of long covid so that's a plus too.",1

"First off, I can’t speak to the specific changes you’re talking about here...33 year old man here. So, I can’t really comment on anything related to cycle changes. But I think for a lot of people, myself included, it’s because many of the symptoms we experience, even if they start several days after a dose, are things we’ve never experienced in our lives. This also contributes to them being even more alarming. Never in my life have I experienced numbness, tingling, ice pick headaches and light sensitivity all at the same time....for 8+ weeks now. You’ll also see many people also preface by saying they’re normally very healthy...I was. No allergies, no other conditions that could explain it (diabetes, autoimmune disorders, etc), very healthy weight, active, etc. There are people with those types of things who are also having reactions to the vaccines...but many of the users I’ve talked to have nothing like that that could also explain what they’re experiencing. Most of us have never had anything like this happen before.Finally, you’ll see many, many people explain that they’ve had bloodwork, MRI’s, nerve conduction tests...all of which would show many of the other things these symptoms could be attributed to. Nothing has shown up on any of the tests I’ve taken. When your PCP and neurologist both shake their heads independently and say they don’t have any other explanations, that has me 100% convinced it’s vaccine-related.","I've also had troubles with numbness and tingling. Would you mind sharing where you've experienced these sensations? Mine have been the arm of the injection site and my neck/cheek area. I'm curious if others have had the same problems as me.",1
"Had my 6 month Moderna booster on Monday (3rd shot)…definitely made me more tired and achey, but my measured Covid antibodies were OK before the shot (via blood test), so feeling great that likely no Actual, life threatening Covid, ahead. Can’t imagine being not being vaxxed at this point anywhere in the USA…suicidal!","Lol suicidal. You know 98% of people survive COVID. And if you had antibodies, that means you have natural immunity. You really shouldn’t be posting about something you clearly know nothing about. That also has nothing to do with the question this person asked. You’re a very bright person",0
"Well there's a couple of factors to consider. Number one, catching the virus is not a definitive antibody certainty, while the vaccine is. Also, you have to keep in mind that even though you're unlikely to catch it again, if you do you can partly contribute to the possibility of an evolution of a new variant which could ultimately cancel out and the antibodies you or anyone else has from either vaccine or infection. Basically, it doesn't matter if you've gotten the virus before or not, get the vaccine.","Yea I can just make up random shit too",0
"There are reamsof explanations of the covid vaccines, or simply, how a vaccine works (in general too) ,  for every kind of \*learner\* and \*learning style\*.

TL;DR especially.     But hey, more power to you if you need to try this hard for somebody that you know or something like that.","Thanks.

I really don’t think I’ll die if I get it. But I might miss 2 weeks of work, which means my husband would miss at least a week to care for our kids, plus messing with quarantine, having a higher chance of passing it on to someone else, long haul symptoms, etc. I’m more curious as to what people think could happen years down the road from getting the vaccine.",1
"If you want to be on the same page with the other side of the family, tell them that you're probably going to get the vaccine in a couple weeks but that you'll watch or read any information they send you about it before then.

"Hopefully it’ll level out soon and dissipate. Until then, definitely give fasting a try. It has many benefits and is a great reset for the body. Also, maybe try a supplement called NAC. A lot of people are using it for vaccine reactions, for long covid and during covid. Maybe Quercitin too. Also green tea for its antioxidant benefits? And I know it’s controversial, but maybe ivermectin. It helps eliminate the spike protein which is likely the culprit. And maybe a keto diet to regulate blood sugar.

"Yup! I got blood samples too that came back fine. I’ve had this happen before from other things though, and I’m thinking it could be from my immune system being stressed from working a lot due to the shot or from the stress and anxiety related to getting the shot.

"Hey, I'm not sure that this counts as similar but here's what happened to me:About 12h after my second dose (June 9th) suddenly my heart rate jumped, I started feeling faint and light headed, nauseous, had diahrrea, was covered in sweat almost instantly (no fever), and my legs started twitching. I also had some kind of ""like falling down"" feeling in my chest, sorry I don't know how to describe that better.All of that happened in 20 mins then I felt a bit better and then after 10-20 mins it started again and it hit in waves.I went to the doctor's that evening, they did a basic blood test (all normal), checked my blood pressure (was quite low), gave me an IV with vitamins and something for my stomach and said it was just a reaction to the vaccine.Couple of hours later my vision blurred, wasn't able to see anything closer than 10m properly (I don't have any issues with my vision generally), like my phone was just a blotch of light and colours.I had the above mentioned ""episodes"" throughout the entire night and the blurry vision the entire next day.The next couple of days I didn't have an appetite at all, had a fever (up to 37.5C), lightheadedness, very fatigued, slept half the time and my heart rate would jump ocassionally (but less intensly than the first night).Now I'm pretty much back to normal most of the time, just sometimes I feel lightheaded and I still feel generally tired.Hope you feel better soon.","I had that falling down feeling in my chest from COVID.

"I'd like to also relieve some of your anxiety. Got my second dose of Pfizer on August 19th.I woke up to a tender and swollen arm pit 2 days later on August 21st. The funny thing is the lump itself is not the tender part since I press on it and feel no pain what so ever. It's soft. The parts that are tender are the edges of the arm pit that connect to my pec as if the tendons/muscles near may be inflamed? I found that stretches for the chest and arm relieve the tightness and tenderness in the area. Hot showers too! It does not feel as tender as it did now 7 days later and the swelling looks a bit the same if not just a tad bit smaller.The pins and needles feeling is also something I've felt in my vaccinated arm, upper traps, and groin area. They are in a very small area and very mild. I massage the spot to stimulate the nerves. My vaccinated arm did feel fuzzy, or like, tingly at times and I stretch it out whenever that happens. Could be minor nerve inflammation as our body mounts a immune response? I've seen others comment about this symptom. I drink green tea and take turmeric to help the body some.","Its been 6 days its currently the 28th of August, the days that followed just my arm itching and hot, yesterday was the first day i actually felt ok, not hot itchy arm and the swelling has gone down, the little ball in my arm pit has also disappeared, for me it was the muscles around the armpit aswell, the little ball hurt a little if i pushed it of course but i let it be. I did take showers but found it only made my arm more hot and itchy afterwards.Its summer where i am so tea is a no thankyou hahaha but i did drink alot of electrolytes and water, plus i took multivitamins aswell to help.

After a week I was concerned enough to go to the Dr, had ECG, blood tests and chest x-rays all of which came back clear/normal.

"I'm not Getting it. I am not concerned about Covid. Never have been.","I'm not either I just want to keep my job lol. guess I'll be paying for a covid test twice a week",2
"No issues you would be fine!","How do you know this? Did you do any scientific studies with enough data to conclude that? The vaccine is new and many problems can evolve in the future. Remember Zantac? A heartburn drug soled OTC in pharmacies for decades. Well, guess what? It turns out the the materials used are known to cause cancer which is why it’s withdrawn now (it’s back now with a new formula).",0
"When I got my 1st Moderna shot I just experienced moderate shivers and a low fever in the eveningBut the night of my 2 shot was the worst 4 hours I have experienced in my whole life, it started with shivers and feeling cold which then transitioned into  involuntary shaking followed by a headache, 1 hour later I started having severe convulsion, the worst migraine I‘ve ever had, extreme cold, extreme sweating, unbearable pain theoughout every fibre of my body while crying through all 4 hours that it happened. I rarely cry and have never cried because of painIm generally pro vaccine and still am, but Im truly traumatized by that experience and will never get a Covid shot againEDIT: I‘ve browsed the web for these symptoms but never found anyone sharing my experience so the likelyhood of this happening to you is very slight","Whats your plan against covid?",1
"I had 2 friends (unvaccinated) spend 8 days in Florida 2 weeks ago. They didn't catch Rona. Maybe you are being a little paranoid.","That’s not how statistics work at all champ",0
"I think the low fever should kick in by either day 1-3. If it's been a week it could be something else. Others here will comment but I don't think I have seen anyone have a fever that far out after any dose.","I totally agree! It seems odd to me too for the side effects to kick in so far out after the vaccine. Maybe it triggered something else?",2
"The testing isn’t reliable. I think it’s best to quarantine if someone in your house is positive, whether you test positive or not. Unfortunately this is not the advice that’s been given, and I’m sure greatly contributed to the bad delta wave. I’ve spoken to *many* people that were told by their doctors that they did not have to stay home from work when their spouse was home sick with covid, just because they were vaccinated…and then they end up sick a few days later and exposed their workplace. You kind of didn’t do anything wrong, because it’s not your fault. The public health guidance just isn’t the best, because they’ve been trying to “reward” vaccinated people and make them feel invisible by giving them as few restrictions as possible.","And i do know these tests aren’t always reliable, this particular one in the fine print says it’s 99% accurate in detecting a negative test and 83% accurate in detecting a positive. I would think after 6 negative tests over the course of the past week i would be good right?",1
"I would put them on a hard information diet, and not be super eager to cultivate a deep relationship with ppl like that, nor seek their approval, family or no. They sound like a handful and a low return on emotional investment.

But that’s me. (I’m old and also happy to tell ppl to FO when they encroach on boundaries. Including relatives.)","I originally had that mindset, when I first came out and they reacted negatively. But over time, they showed me they were trying and my mom especially has actually grown to be an awesome support system. They are misinformed, and can have very odd opinions. But they don’t really hurt me when it comes down to it, so I foster the relationship with some boundaries. I am just unsure as to whether this particular fight is one worth having",0
"I know an unvaxxed person that got re-infected within 8 months","Did they survive? Any long term negative impacts?",1
"It probably is because of the vaccine. The vaccine has caused inflammation for me as well","Yeah i had unknown bactereal infection for 2 months right after vaccine",1
"Most people have flare ups in first 4 days.","Thanks! What are some of the reported side effects if you know? I got the Pfizer vaccine, any specifics on that?",1
"Canadian here. First dose AZ 8 weeks ago, second dose Moderna today. I had a bit of a rough reaction to dose one (nothing that required medical attention, just like at 24-48 hr moderate flu bug). I've read to anticipate a bit of a reaction to the Moderna too, so am prepped just in case.","Are you planning to take 2 doses from moderna or just the first dose? Thank you",1
"that's a question you would need to talk your doctor about.  Seriously!","Yes I did, they don't really have answers.",1
"Don't take J&J. It has been causing a lot of cases of Guillain Barre in my country.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. Mine wasn't so serious as yours, but it has been 2 months the Pfizer vaccine has caused me Bell's Palsy and I honestly don't think I'll ever recovery. I'm having no improvement at all. My second dose is scheduled for next month and I'm deadly afraid. Unfortunatelly, I'm in the same place as you too. I'm FORCED to take it or I won't even be able to enter a restaurant or get a job anymore.","I’m praying for you! I am so sorry they are literally taking you personal freedom it’s so fucked up",1
"Got the Moderna booster yesterday late in the day, felt generally well but feel a little fatigued and weak now.No big deal, just feel like sleeping and none of the napping today seems like enough.Nothing to complain about really.","Yeah, I'm on hour 20 and noticing the sleepy, weak and  a bit dizzy when I stand feeling.  Staying in bed today!  EDIT: weaky isn't a word",1
"I work in an industry that has a partial vaccine mandate (ie people whose jobs put them in close proximity must be vaccinated) all those people must also be tested 3x a week.we still have breakthrough cases but no major outbreaks. The surveillance testing does a good job of removing infected people right away.","Where are you located if you don’t mind me asking?",1
"I know @vinguptamd at University of Washington said their research team felt this was safe for hospital staff exposed to Covid patients to get either Pfizer or Moderna. I am conservative and would wait for guidance from National Institute of Health or CDC. Dr. Gupta does try to reply to people if he can.I did have headaches after Pfizer2 for a week. However, I have had migraines last 2 years.Edited","Thank you! Maybe I’ll wait a bit…",1
"I’m fully vaccinated and pro vaccine. I received moderna and developed disequilibrium a few days after my second dose. It’s been 5 months and it still comes and goes. Have 3 friends with the same issue after moderna. Maybe it’s unrelated. But I really doubt it.","Is that better than the possibility of getting covid and having a 99% survival rate? I'm very serious, if that's what is happening currently with you, do you fear long term issues because of the shot?",0
"Of course. Point? No one ever said it is 100% effective. Yeah, don't wear seat belts or a helmet because some people die wearing them. Brilliant","Totally not the same. I understand your point though. And again...how can someone think they can mandate it? Because they can't. And 2nd, it's definitely not 100% effective because vaccinated can still get covid and they can still pass it on. And another thing...t delta variant didn't exist until people started getting vaccinated...not saying it's the vaccine..just pointing it out. And sure...things evolve. Just...again...doesn't make sense. Especially when the source and stories and recommendations have changed quite a few times.",0
"Sounds exactly like my experience, with the 2nd Moderna jab.   8 hours of fever, chills, arm ached a lot, joint / muscle aches, so bad sleep that night as a result.  Next day a lot of fatigue.  Probably from not sleeping well.   Went back to bed for a nap, since I had a headache.     Late evening I was able to take a short walk and by next day I was pretty much symptom free.","Good to hear no more symptoms, glad to hear it's kinda normal at least haha",1
"Never. You're the test group.","Bullshit. Your body has fully cleared the vaccin within weeks. Stop fearmongering.",0
"Did the pfizer jab affect your endurance? Are you quicker out of breath than before?","Yes to both.",1
"Four rather  obvious conclusions about the vaccines:1. the creators of the vaccines didn't really know what they might do to people, in widespread use;2. the doctors don't know how to deal with the side effects, as they had no direction from the vaccine creators;3. medical science is currently studying effects in the population, in order to determine what they will do and how to treat them.4. This is not how we usually do things.","Couldn't agree more sadly. It's why hubs and I aren't participating in the grand experiment. We're taking our chances with nutrition, heavy supplements and homebrewed elderberry syrup taken daily.",2
"My ER visit cost me 600$ tho.  :(","Just sue pfizer or moderna for the side eff.... oh wait",2
"How are you all describing this? 9 months here. Sucks ass this.","I’m scared the pressure headaches jaw pain eye pin teeth pain is too much no pain killers work",1
"Corona Realism claims that the least vaccinated places are having the least cases now (based on the first graph). Except the first graph is about the delta variant, literally says so in fine print under the graph: Source John Hopkins Covid 19 Delta. Its showing places where the delta variant is surging, not where COVID as a whole is surging. Conclusion: Corona Realism doesn't know how to read graphs.","I'm confused. You'd think covid or varient, least vaccinated places showing to have least number of cases should make you go hm",2
"I have chest achiness and tightness after the first shot of pfizer, I am a young, low BMI male and my heart rate is at 70-80 (probably higher than usual, although I don't have a reference point). End of fifth day, it's not resolving. I would like to ask if you also feel pains from the SIDES of your chest, as in, below-the-armpit-but-still-at-the-chest-part-of-the-body-place. Wondering if our experiences are in any way similar.Hoping that you will get better. The lack of information yet the amount of people reporting these things is worrying.","I'm sorry to hear it's affected you. I haven't experienced the kind of pain you're describing. I did have a bit of pain on my breastplate, and a difficult to describe sensation in my chest, almost like a tingling. That's pretty much gone. Now it's just the fast heartbeat. Hopefully we both recover soon.",1
"News today said J and J is not effective against delta!","It didn't say ""not effective""!",0
"Go see a cardiologist and see what you can do to prevent blood clot prior to the vaccine","Not taking the injection would be the best bet. 100% risk reduction.",0
"It doesn't matter if you are vaccinated or not. You can still spread the virus. Furthermore, with the new varient you are more at risk for complications having been vaccinated for the past strain. The vaccinated are spreading the virus more as they believe that they cannot catch nor spread the virus anymore and are not wearing masks or distancing any more.","It does matter if you are vaccinated.

Vaccinated people are much less likely to get covid and less likely to spread it.

If they do get a breakthrough infection, they are likely to recover faster and therefore are contagious for a shorter period of time.

They are also much less likely to get seriously ill. Very unlikely to get hospitalized or die. Which means they won't take up hospital resources.

It's the UN-vaccinated that are causing large outbreaks and spreading the virus more.",0
"I have this after the first shot so I am worried for the second :(","But it went away, right?",1
"Yes, the vaccine is safe for you! Covid-19 is not safe for you. If you currently have cancer or are receiving radiation, there is some evidence that you might have a weakened response to two vaccines. A weak immune system is one of the BEST reasons to get vaccinated, not forego the vaccine","Lol this is so cringe. It’s like you don’t even understand what you are saying.",0
"It's obvious why the rotavirus vaccine is relevant to this topic. Tell me why it's not relevant. I gave you the details as to why it's relevant. If you don't know why your claim that it's irrelevant is true then don't say it.","You tell me why it is. Its not even in the same family as coronaviruses and it affects only a specific age group, children. The details you gave me arent have no significance to the actual situation you are trying to prove.",0
"Is there an explanation for myocarditis? Blood clots? How exactly do these occur if the vaccine is supposed to stay in the injection site, the deltoid muscle?","Not saying it's the mechanism with the vaccines, but typically myocarditis is caused by the immune response. You can get myocarditis from having a cold.",1
