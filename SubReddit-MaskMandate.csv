I’ve accidentally offended users I didn’t know were mods and was then subsequently banned from every sub the guy moderated “for being an asshole”. Subs with other mods relinquished the ban but they weren’t anything I’d ever comment in or join.. I think the whole mod system needs to be revamped. The appeal process is hard to run through on a sub with one rogue mod or others where only one active mod is left.. or people using multiple accounts as different mods. It’s pretty corrupt.

Or it wouldn't be if it wasn't so sad.And the real sad part? You think masks are the big difference here? The politicians, powers that be, and health authorities want these ""CODE RED"" lockdowns, whether or not people are wearing masks.

Between that and case numbers skyrocketing here, my wife and I have started to tune into a different local church's online service.The part that bugs me most is that we attend churches that follow Martin Luther's teachings. In discussing the 5th commandment, You shall not murder, he says ""What does this mean? We should fear and love God so that we do no bodily harm to our neighbor, but help and befriend him in every need."" This is something my small parochial school had me memorize by the time I was 8. I don't love wearing a mask. It's annoying, my glasses fog up when it's cold outside. But I will because it's a show of respect to others.","We may have different church upbringing but AMEN TO THAT TEACHING!!!!!

Covid is mostly spread indoors through aerosols, which are very tiny particles of water vapor which carry the virus.

Masks are causing more harm than they are worth, which can be seen on the faces of many teens-acne, psychological harm, miscommunication, streptococcus colony migration, and more. The masks are just a simple signal that you “care,” but I might add with ignorance.

"What is clear, however, is that universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it’s not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown. A mask alone will not prevent health care workers with early Covid-19 from contaminating their hands and spreading the virus to patients and colleagues. Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures.”I’m assuming when you wear a fresh mask every time? You don’t touch it or handle it or put it in your pocket right?","You’re confusing the term “prevent” with the term “mitigate.”  Wearing masks alone(as your source states) wont stop the chance of you contracting a virus 100% but what about 10%, 20? 30?

"Anti-masker here, I'll tell you how I could be convinced to wear a mask, if you are interested.For starters, it's not about if, in the abstract, masks work or not. After all, surgeons have been wearing masks for a long time, and plague doctors wore masks centuries ago. It's about convincing us that the current situation warrants them. After all, flu season has existed for a long time, and no one thought to turn off the economy or muzzle the population until now. And the fact is, if it was not for the constant news bombardment about this thing, I would literally be unaware there was a pandemic going on. I expect your friend is the same; start by convincing him that Covid is a serious enough thing to warrant a mask. This will probably be the most difficult step.Also, and this part I cannot emphasize enough, DO NOT GASLIGHT. Acknowledge that it is horrible, and will suck, but convince him that it is less horrible, and will suck less, than the consequences of not wearing a mask. But this barrage of people saying ""It's not a big deal"" and ""It's just a thin piece of cloth"" comes across as disingenuous and an attempt to trick us. This is not a good tactic.On a related note, calling him an ""evil grandma-killing sociopath"" or ""stupid"" will also not change his mind. It will only vindicate him.Finally, convince him that it will, in fact, be temporary. This will be difficult since you are not the person making the law, but as an anti-masker, Covidskeptical person, who has read a book before, I have little faith that these ""temporary measures"" are in fact temporary, leading me to resent them. If I could be certain of an end date for mask bylaws, I would be more likely to comply with them.Good luck to you.","I really don't need to convice him that covid is a dangetous disease.

"Hold on... what doctors are saying this? Jesus Christ I hate anti-vaccinationers","I haven't found any doctors saying it, but around April I was encountering a troubling amount of nurses and staff at medical facilities who were eligible for a vaccine but didn't have plans to get it any time soon.

Pretty simple honestly","""You can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart. You can gather indoors with unvaccinated people of any age from one other household (for example, visiting with relatives who all live together) without masks or staying 6 feet apart, unless any of those people or anyone they live with has an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. You can gather or conduct activities outdoors without wearing a mask except in certain crowded settings and venues."" Straight from the CDC.",0

"Beautifully said","I agree, now after reading what you said. I myself didn’t really think about wearing masks after Covid, I originally just thought “oh if there’s no covid then there’s no need for masks” which is true to some degrees, but like you said masks are to prevent others from getting “sick”, not really to prevent others from getting “covid”, because sick umbrellas covid. If I ever get sick after the pandemic I will wear a mask.

My original thoughts of the mask was somewhere along the lines of “oh wow this corona thing is very severe that we must stay inside and wear masks”",2

"Eh, this simply isn't true, as worded. Wearing a mask is uncomfortable in multiple ways. There's a huge difference between ""totally worth it"" and ""no reason not to wear it"". I'm getting a little tired of hearing anti-anti-maskers acting like masks are so unbothersome that they might just wear them for fun after this is all over. You're accidentally making a moot and false argument that masks are super comfortable and not even the slightest bit restrictive (as if comfort is what should define you wearing it), instead of the important argument that they're worth wearing. So an anti-masker could technically say this is dumb and wrong, and they'd be right. And if an anti-masker is right, you said something wrong.","Uncomfortable yes, worth throwing a fit over? No.",1

"Not sure what your logic is here.. just because someone doesn't wear a mask doesn't mean they get it. In fact, masks have a negligible effect in reducing spread.","Good thing you won't be reproducing.",0

"Seriously, these things are pretty much useless. It doesn't stop anything from getting in your face. They don't stop any spray from sneezing or coughing. You might as well wear nothing for as much good as it's doing.Edit: its not super clear from the picture, but this ""shield"" comes up from the chin to just over the nose.

There’s a pandemic with the death rate of about 2mil and you think a mask that’s meant to protect other as well as yourself from a virus is in some way shape or form a muzzle?

"The original virus may have 99.98 survival rate, but people like this increase the variant rate. So yeah evolution is proven again, potential at the cost of a lot of people.","The survival rate of the virus is more like 98%; in other words, about one in 50 people die of it.

Notice how the Covidiots love to use the survival rate instead of the mortality rate because it sounds better. Kind of like ""95% fat free"" sounds better than ""5% fat"".",1
"Could be me but all that mask wearing and hand washing probably kept the flu numbers down, amongst other things.","It is. It's the exact reason why.",2
"What a sissy. Wearing clothes. Ha!","I bet he also doesn't wear seatbelts and doesn't follow road rules!",2
"You just parroted everything the media has been saying.","Yes because the scientists tell the media what’s going on and why, so the people can be properly informed in the age of technology.",0

"It is so painfully sad that in order to explain masks to adults, we need to use an analogy that you would use on a 5 year old child.","Yeah, that’s why I have the lowest of expectations. I am often shocked at the lack of humility, love, kindness, thoughtfulness, and rationality that most humans have. Because I’m sure that on some subjects I appear very similar, I have set out on a quest to avoid expecting anything of anyone outside my closest circle. This has brought me closer to reality, and further from some construct I was led to believe was or would be real at some point in my life.

If masks didn’t help me at all, but did prevent .000001% of others around me from getting sick, I’d still wear it. My thinking is why take any chance with someone else’s health. Most people don’t think that way. They want what they want and they are happy to step on someone else’s neck to get it due to some kind of perverse sense of “deserving”.

We deserve nothing. We are born, we live, and we die. Each persons circumstances are different.",2
